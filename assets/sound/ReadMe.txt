For reduced clutter, I would recommend placing the sound files in C:\Windows\Media\Legion
(you'll have to make that last folder) since that is where Windows looks for the sounds.
To set these, go to Control Panel>Personalization>Sounds (for Windows Vista and 7) or
Control Panel>Sounds And Audio Devices>Sounds Tab (for Windows XP) and then set them however you like.
I have included recommendations for what each file should be used in the file names, 
but since some files are pulling double duty, I'm going to write out exactly what I set mine too.

And below that I haven't changed anything.

Enjoy!
